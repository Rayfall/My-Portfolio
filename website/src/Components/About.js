            <h1>Who Am I...</h1>
            <p>My name is Andrew Grant and I am a software developer. My career transition has been one of perseverance and self-motivation. I started out being a driver at a chain chicken restaurant. After getting into a car accident, I asked the owners to give me a chance to be a cook, since that was more of a passion for me. For two and a half years, I rose from being a new cook, to a trusted manager. I decided to jump more into the field of technology and joined the City of Rochester as a client services intern, fixing various computer problems and being a dependable employee. I worked diligently on and off for about six years with the city, having my hand in various projects, learning more about networking, cyber security, database managing, and management in general. My skills as a professional worker grew considerably during this time. During the time I was not working with the City, I worked in research, in different website development positions, and even in a software engineering internship. I have added value to every team I have been on through my advice, my help, and my unique creativity. My career goals are to gain experience as a real worker of a software engineering company. Iâ€™d like to work with web applications in a software engineering role.
